# Where are my Files

When CaDoodle is installed it is just an auto-updater. The updater will download the correct JVM, the current application JAR and all of the example objects on the first time it loads. that means that CaDoodle needs the Internet active for the first time it opens, or you need to copy these files from a working CaDoodle application to get it to work on an air-gapped machine. 

Once these files are downloaded, then CaDoodle will work without any Internet access whatsoever.
